# Explanation 5 features of my project:

* introduction: 
My project name is `corporate event management`. When a user come to my project
 then he/she will see a `navbar` which 4 pages `Home`, `Services`, `Our Works`,
`Location` and will see a `Login` button in the right side and a `logo` in the left
 side of our company.If the user `registered` or `logged in` so will see two extra 
pages named `Client Feedback` and `Team Members` and at the same time will see a `Log Out`
 button, `User name` and `user profile` in the right side of navbar if user put
his `name` and his `photoURL` when `registered`. When user click on the `Home` will see 
`Home Page` content where are a `Banner`, a `Our Services` Section, a `Our Works` 
section, `Location` section and a '`Footer`.In the same way when `click` on the `Client
 Feedback` or `Team Members` will see the specific `routes` data.
* Route Explain:
When a user `click` on the `Services` in the `navbar` will see the `Service Cards`, 
when `click` on the `Our Works` in the navbar will see the `work cards` and if `click` on 
the `Location` will see our `location`.In the same way see client feedback and team members by 
clicking `Client Feedback` and `Team Members` route.
* View Details Button:
In the `Services` section every service card have a `View Details` Button. If a
 user `registerd` or `logged in` will see the card `details`.If not `registered` or `logged in`
will not see the card `details`.
* Log In:
When a user go to `log in` and `click` on the `Login` button then he/she will go to `log in`
page. If the user already `registered` so user will log in `successfully` and show a `sweet
alert` `'Thank You!'` and `Your logged in successfully.` But if the user is not `registered` or
put `wrong` `email` or `password` then show a `sweet alert` `Oh!` and `firebase` own `error message`.
If the user not `registered` so he/she will go to `registration` page by `clicking` `Register` in 
the below of the `Login` button of the Log in form. When a user will be `registration` would have 
user `name`, `photoURL`, `email`, `password` and must accept `checkbox`. If the user will not accept 
the `checkbox` will show a `sweet alert` `Oh!` and `Please accept our Terms and Conditions`.
* Password:
When a user try to `registration` and in the time of `put` his `password` he/she would have at least 
`6 characte`r, `a capital letter` and `a special letter`.If the user will not put at least 
`6 character` , `a capital letter` and `a special letter` then show a `sweet alert` `Please should be at least 
6 character, a capital letter and a special letter.`
