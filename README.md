2.
Answer: C: "12"
Explain: Here declare a function named sum which is two parameter a and b. When call this function and set two value 1 and "2" and when run it answer is "12".Because here 1 is a number but "2" is a string. We know that if any number declare in the "" that is a string. That's why the answer is "12". 

3. 
Answer: A: ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']
Explain: Here declare an array named food which is 4 items and an object named info which is a property that's key is favoriteFood and value is food[0] that means "üçï". In the 3rd line reassign a value of info.favoriteFood to "üçù" then change the value of favoriteFood in the info object from "üçï" to "üçù".But when console the array food then it's value is not change.Because When reassigning the value of info.favoriteFood dose not effect the orginal food array. Because they are separate value with there own values.
4.
Answer: B: Hi there, undefined
Explain: Here declare a function named sayHi which is a parameter `name`. The function return `Hi there, ${name}`. When console the function or call then answer is `Hi there, undefined`.Because when call the function by sayHi() then no parameter pass the function that means parameter is not defined that's why the result is 'Hi there, undefined'.
5. 
Answer: C: 3
Explain: There is an array it contains 4 elements [0,1,2,3] and a variable initilized  to 0. Then use the forEach method to iterate through each element of the nums array and increment the count variable by 1 if the element num is truthy.
 At first num set 0 that is first element of the array and the condition `if(num)` evalutes to false. Because 0 is a falsy value in javaScript and count remain 0. The num set 1,2,3 one by one and every time the condition `if(num)` evalutes to true Because every element is truthy value and at the same time count is incremented by 1 in three times that's why `count` contains the value is 3.
